classdef SimuCell_Object_Model <SimuCell_Model
%SIMUCELL_object_model   The template class from which all plugins for
% defining object models (shapes of cells, nuclei) are defined.
%
%SIMUCELL_OBJECT_MODEL methods:
%  make_shape     - A function that returns a binary
%    mask(image_height,image_width) of the shape of the object
%    being drawn.
%  prerendered_object_list - A function that returns a cell array
%    containing all the other objects (nuclei, cells etc) that are
%    required by the make_shape function. Each element is  of type
%    SimuCell_Object. This function is used internally by the engine to
%    determine the order in which objects should be drawn.

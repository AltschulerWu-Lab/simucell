classdef SimuCell_Marker_Operation <SimuCell_Model
%SIMUCELL_MARKER_OPERATION   The template class from which all plugins
%for markers are derived. Each plugin defines a single operation,
%and a series of operation is performed sequentially to set the final
%marker distribution.
%
%SimuCell_Marker_Operation methods:
%  Apply - A function that returns the intensity of the marker at
%    every pixel in the image after application of the marker operation.
%  needed_shape_list - A function that returns a cell array containing
%    all the other objects (nuclei, cells etc) that are required by
%    the make_shape function. Each element is  of type SimuCell_Object.
%    This function is used internally by the engine to determine the
%    order in which objects should be drawn.
%  prerendered_marker_list - A function that returns a cell array
%    containing all the other markers (defined on a specific shape) that
%    are required by the Apply function. Each element of the cell is  of
%    type Marker_Operation_Queue. This function is used internally by
%    the engine to determine the order in which markers should be
%    rendered.

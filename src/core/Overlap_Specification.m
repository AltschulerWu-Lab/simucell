classdef Overlap_Specification <handle
%Overlap_Specification class used to define how shape will overlap
%
%Overlap_Specification Properties: (Private)
%
%Overlap_Specification Methods:
%  AddOverlap - Set the overlapp values between a list of objects
%    -object_list:   the list of object
%    -overlap_value: the overlap value 0- no overlapp, 1 full overlap
%    allowed (1 shape can 100% overlap the other one).
%       Range Value: 0 to 1
%
%  construct_overlap_matrix - build the overlap matrix
%    -subpopulations: subpopulations strcuture containing the full
%    subpopulations information. Used internally by the engine.
%
%Usage:
%overlap=Overlap_Specification;
%overlap.AddOverlap({subpop{1}.objects.cytoplasm,...
%  subpop{2}.objects.cytoplasm},0.05);
%simucell_data.overlap=overlap;
